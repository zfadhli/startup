                The Generator App is an online tool that helps you to export ready-made templates
                ready to work as your future website. It helps you to combine slides, panels and
                other components and export it as a set of static files: HTML/CSS/JS.

              <p className="text-gray-500">
                No, hosting is on you. You upload the result on your hosting via FTP or using other
                tools you like. You can use any server, just make sure it have a PHP installed in
                case if you need a contact form.

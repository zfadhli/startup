            We have created this demo version in order to show you the structure of Startup
            Framework. It has some of the components from the full version, 2 great samples
            (Bootstrap themes) and documentation. You can also find 2 images of a Macbook and an
            iPad, which you can use in your project. We hope you will like your first introduction
            to Startup Framework. The most important part of the Startup Framework are the samples
            or Bootstrap themes and templates. The samples consist of a set of few pages you can use
            «as is» or add new blocks from UI Kit.
